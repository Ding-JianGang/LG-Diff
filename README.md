# LG-Diff
Learning to Follow Local Class-Regional Guidance for Nearshore Image Cross-Domain High-Quality Translation
This is the PyTorch implementation of the color-to-thermal image translation. The code is based on the PyTorch implementation of the ThermalGAN (https://github.com/vlkniaz/ThermalGAN) and DiffIR (https://github.com/Zj-BinXia/DiffIR).

## Prerequisites
Linux or Win10 

Python 3 

NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Dataset

## Demo-
Demo- files is used to verify the effectiveness of the local class region guidance strategy on diffusers. It can be trained directly.
